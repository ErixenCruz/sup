Stateful:
The client and server both keep track of the state that the conversation is in
through a state variable. Messages are checked to make sure that they are for
the appropriate state. If the message is inappropriate, it is discarded and
the connection is closed.

Concurrent:
The server uses the multiprocessing library to be able to handle multiple
clients simultaneously. Each client request is given a process which serves
it. 

Service:
The server listens on 8492 and the client also defaults to ping there.

Client:
The user can specify the IP address of the server or hostname. The python
socket library deals with both automatically. The user gives it to the protocol
on the command line

UI:
The user interacts with the client application protocol through the command line.

Extra credit:
I did not attempt the extra credit.
